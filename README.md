##Swiss Tournament Database

This program represents the back end for an application
that manages a Swiss tournament. The back end supports:
*Player addition and removal, including even  or odd numbers of players
*Match addition and removal, with possible outcomes Win, Loss, Draw, or Bye
*Player pairing for tournament rounds (players ranked according to score, where
wins worth 3, byes worth 3, draws worth 1 - players with the same score are
ranked according to opponent match wins)

This code builds on the code provided within the Udacity course
[Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197) and was completed as part of the 
course requirements for the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Running the Program
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/marknagelberg/tournament`
* Run tournament.sql, which defines the tables and views
* Use the various functions defined in tournament.py to manage the tournament.
* tournament_test.py provides various unit tests to help ensure the database is running properly.
